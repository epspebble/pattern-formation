# pattern-formation

Purpose of this repository is to perform reproducible numerical experiments of:

1. Generation of patterns from continuum models (like reaction-diffusion systems including Gray-Scott, Gierer-Meinhardt...) and discrete models (agent-based models etc...)

2. Enumeration and identification of patterns (topological data analysis etc...)

3. Analysis of pattern change (computation of bifurcation diagrams etc... )
